This includes tasks such as user account management, software installation, security hardening, performance monitoring, backup management, and troubleshooting — ensuring servers remain secure, stable, and performant.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is Linux preferred for server administration?",
    a: "Linux is the dominant server operating system worldwide due to its stability, security, flexibility, and open-source nature. It runs reliably for years without restarts, has a vast ecosystem of server software, costs nothing in licensing fees, and has exceptional community support for rapid bug fixes and updates.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a Linux server administration do?",
    a: "A Linux server administrator installs and configures server software, manages user accounts and permissions, implements security controls, monitors system performance, manages backups and disaster recovery, applies patches and updates, and troubleshoots issues to maintain service availability.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a Linux server administration secure?",
    a: "Yes. Linux has a strong security model with robust user permission controls, mandatory access control frameworks (SELinux/AppArmor), powerful firewall tools (iptables/nftables), and a vast security community. When properly configured and regularly patched, Linux servers provide an excellent security baseline.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does Linux server administration cost?",
    a: "Costs depend on the number of servers, the level of support required, and the complexity of your environment. We offer flexible monthly retainer packages as well as project-based engagements. Contact us for a free, no-obligation quote tailored to your needs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a server administrator for my business?",
    a: "If your business relies on servers for hosting, databases, applications, or internal systems, having a dedicated Linux administrator is essential for maintaining security, performance, and availability. Outsourcing to specialists is often more cost-effective than hiring in-house and provides broader expertise.",
